# Casval/config
A cool repo for awesome config files.

# How to use
	- Step 1: Download repo into ~/ or wherever.
	- Step 1b: Download using HTTPS so you don't accidentially upload private info. Alternatively, if you downlod into a different folder and use symlinks or copy it into your user folder then whatev.
	- Step 2: Delete .git folder if you copied it into ~ (this is optional but recommended)
	- Step 5: Eat something, you are probably really hungy at this point.

# Adding more files
Put them in the repo. That's it. If you use submodules then you'll probably have to add a flag when you check it out. I don't remember what the flag is. TODO: Look up submodule command stuff
